# Home & House Real Estate Agency

Git issues and pull requests were heavily used to facilitate team-based development of this project, as was Slack and face-to-face communication.

###### This is a mobile-first web app containing the following features:

* User authentication (allows real estate agent to sign in and add / edit / delete properties)
* File uploads (uploading of images)
* Filtering of properties according to specified criteria (price, number of bedrooms/bathrooms/parking spaces, location, property type)
* Admin dashboard
* Contact form


###### Gems used include:

* [Shrine](https://github.com/janko-m/shrine) for handling images
* [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem) for easy styling of webpages using Bootstrap 4
* [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) to enable real estate agents to log in and list / edit properties
